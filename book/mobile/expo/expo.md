# 1. What is Expo?

Expo is a toolset for building React Native apps (a sdk with a vercel business type but focused to react native apps). It simplifies the process of creating mobile apps by providing a set of tools and services that handle the heavy lifting, like managing native code, so you can focus more on writing JavaScript.

# 2. What is Expo Go?

Expo Go is an app you can install on your phone to preview and test your Expo projects. It’s like a browser for your React Native app, but instead of browsing websites, it runs your React Native code.

# 3. Difference Between Expo Go and a Development Build

Expo Go:

- Predefined Setup: Expo Go has a fixed set of features and packages already included, which are the core features provided by Expo. Think of it like a sandbox where you can quickly test your app, but you can only use the toys (features) already in the sandbox.

- No Custom Native Code: You can’t add new native code (like custom integrations with device hardware) in Expo Go.

Development Build:

- Fully Customizable: This is a version of your app that includes any extra features or custom native code you need. You’re not limited to the sandbox—you can bring in your own toys (custom features) and use them however you like.
