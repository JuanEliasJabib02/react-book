# Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Reactivity in React

Reactivity is at the core of every modern application, and React is no exception. In this chapter, we'll explore what reactivity means in React, how itâ€™s achieved through the use of state and side effects, and why mastering these concepts is key to building interactive and performant applications.

## 1.1 What is Reactivity?

Reactivity is the mechanism by which an application automatically updates its user interface (UI) in response to data changes. Imagine your UI as a living entity: when something changes in its environment (like a user input, a network request, or time passing), it adapts instantly. In React, this reactivity makes applications dynamic, interactive, and efficient.

In essence, reactivity means that data drives the UI. As data changes, the UI changes. This is accomplished in React by:

- State management: The internal memory of a component, which stores values that may change over time.
- Side effects: External operations (like API calls or DOM manipulations) triggered by changes in state.
