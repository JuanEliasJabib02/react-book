- relation between data fetching layer and create a rich ux experience in the app.
- Choosing Between Local Storage and Zustand

Local Storage:

Best For: Data that needs to be persistent across browser sessions and remains available even if the user navigates away from the page or closes the browser.
Not Ideal For: Managing complex or frequently changing application state that requires real-time updates or complex interactions.
Zustand:

Best For: Managing and sharing state within a React application that needs to be reactive and update dynamically as the user interacts with the app.

Not Ideal For: Storing data persistently across sessions. For persistent data, integrate Zustand with local storage or other methods.

Combining Both

Persistent State with Zustand: You can use Zustand for state management within your app and combine it with local storage to persist certain pieces of state across browser sessions. For example, you might store user preferences or authentication tokens in local storage and use Zustand to manage the application state.
Summary

Use Local Storage for persistent data that needs to survive across browser sessions.

Use Zustand for managing state within a React application that needs to be reactive and shared between components.
By understanding the roles of each, you can choose the right tool for the task and combine them effectively if needed.
