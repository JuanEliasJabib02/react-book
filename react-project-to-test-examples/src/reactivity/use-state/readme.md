# Essencional things about useState

useState is a React hook that enables functional components to manage and maintain local state. It provides a way to store and update data that affects how a component renders and behaves.

## How useState Works

When using useState, you declare state variables and their updater functions inside your functional component. This hook allows you to persist state between renders and ensures that updates to state trigger re-renders of the component.
