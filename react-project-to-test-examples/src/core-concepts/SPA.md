# What is a single page application

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without refreshing the entire page.

## Benefits of an SPA:

- Faster User Experience: Only the necessary content is loaded and updated, making interactions quick.

- Smooth Navigation: Seamless transitions without full page reloads.

- Reduced Server Load: Less processing on the server since only data is fetched as needed.

- Easier Development: Frontend and backend can be developed independently, often making development more streamlined.

## Thoughts

- Differents kinds that SPA exist?
- When use a SPA?
- Nextjs dont use SPA?
