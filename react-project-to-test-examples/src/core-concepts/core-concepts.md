# Core concepts of computer science, focused to web and mobile

## CPU(Central Processing Unit)

The CPU is like the brain of our computer or mobile, it's perform calculations and run
the instructions, making everything work.

## RAM (Memory)

RAM is the temporary space where data and instructions are stored while your programs are running.

## Analogy to understand it.

CPU: Think of the CPU like a chef in a kitchen. The chef (CPU) reads recipes (instructions) and prepares meals (processes data). Just as the chef follows recipes to cook dishes, the CPU follows instructions to perform tasks on your device.

Memory (RAM): Imagine the kitchen countertop where the chef places all the ingredients and tools needed for cooking. This countertop (memory) holds everything the chef needs to work quickly and efficiently. The more space available on the countertop, the more ingredients (data) and tools (programs) the chef can use at once.

In summary:

CPU is like the chef who performs the cooking (processing).
Memory (RAM) is like the countertop where ingredients and tools are kept for easy access.
